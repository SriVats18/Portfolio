<h2>There are 3 top movies that I like</h2>

<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>It's an anime based on a shinigami's notebook which can kill people just by writing their name in it and it's pretty much thriller and mysterious movie..</p>
<h3>Day Dreamer</h3>
<p>It's a Turkish drama representing a long love story and I relly love that story..</p>
<h3>All of us are dead</h3>
<p>It's a movie based on zombies and it has some thrill and horror so I like it..</p>
